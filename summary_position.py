#Script for the Summary by Position table. Given in input a targets.txt ordered by clusters, for each cluster (position) it saves: 
# -chr
# -pos
# -best target sequence
# -min mms of cluster
# -min bulge of cluster
# -Total targets with 0 mm
# -Total targets with 1 mm
# ...
# -Total targets with n mm
# -Total targets with 0 bulges
# -Total targets with 1 bulges
# ...
# -Total targets with b bulges

# argv1 is targets.txt ordered in clusters
# argv2 is job_id
# argv3 is guide
# argv4 is mms
# argv5 is bulge (max between DNA and RNA)
